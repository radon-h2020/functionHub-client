### Roadmap for FunctionHUB cli ###

_please add features to the list_

New features:

 * ~~When a feature is completed, add a strikethrough~~
 * Avoid hardcoding url, but rather set url in config.ini or alternative .functionhub/settings etc
 * Create a method called 'package/zip' that zips a folder
 * Create a method called 'show/describe' that prints out the config.ini. To see what will 


Ideas:

* Making the cli into a distributed pip package
