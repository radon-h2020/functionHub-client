### Roadmap for FunctionHUB cli ###

_please add features to the list_

New features:

 * ~~When a feature is completed, add a strikethrough~~
 * Avoid hardcoding url, but rather set url in config.ini or alternative .functionhub/settings etc
 * ~~Create a method called 'package/zip' that zips a folder~~
 * Create a method called 'show/describe' that prints out the config.ini. To see what will 
 * Add login command to call the login API and if login is successful, set a flag in the global_config = poor man's login
 * Add list command to list artifacts from a given repo 

Ideas:

* Making the cli into a distributed pip package
